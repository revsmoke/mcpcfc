# ColdFusion MCP Server - Summary

## What We've Built

We've created the **world's first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation in ColdFusion**! This groundbreaking implementation enables ColdFusion applications to serve as tool providers for AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and other LLM applications.

## Key Achievements

1. **Full MCP Protocol Support**
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport
   - Proper session management
   - Tool discovery and execution

2. **Production-Ready Architecture**
   - Thread-safe components using Java concurrent utilities
   - Modular design for easy extension
   - Security-first approach
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **ColdFusion-Native Features**
   - Leverages CFCs for clean object-oriented design
   - Uses native query execution for database access
   - Integrates with CF's built-in security functions
   - Compatible with existing CF applications
