6. Implemented stdio bridge for Claude Desktop integration (cf-mcp-clean-bridge.sh)
7. Fixed JSON-RPC field ordering using structNew("ordered") to ensure spec compliance
8. Added `<cfsetting enableCFOutputOnly="true">` and `<cfcontent reset="yes">` to eliminate extra output
9. Implemented proper notification handling (no response for notifications)
10. Added resources/list and prompts/list handlers to eliminate "method not found" errors
11. ✅ VERIFIED: Fixed JSON parsing error handling in both CLI bridges (cf-mcp-cli-bridge.cfm and cf-mcp-cli-bridge-v2.cfm)
    - Separated JSON parsing into dedicated try-catch blocks (lines 131-147)
    - Proper error codes: -32700 for parse errors, -32603 for internal errors
    - Safe message.id access only after successful parsing (parseError check on line 150)
    - Prevents undefined variable access in error handlers (message only used when parseError = false)
    - Fixed stdin reader initialization issues (lines 63-71)
    - Comprehensive test coverage for parse error scenarios
12. Enhanced tagContext safety in REPLTool.cfc error handling (DOUBLE-REINFORCED)
    - Added multiple layers of defensive checks before accessing e.tagContext array elements
    - Wrapped tagContext operations in nested try-catch blocks to prevent any secondary exceptions
    - Enhanced getLineInfoFromException() with additional safety validation
    - Safely reconstruct exception objects when passing between thread contexts
    - Verify array bounds, element types, and line number validity before access
    - Ensure stackTrace is always a valid array in responses
    - Prevents new exceptions from masking original error messages under all scenarios
    - Tested with edge cases, concurrent requests, and malformed exception structures
13. Improved test-devtools.sh script robustness
    - Fixed shebang line from `#/usr/bin/env` to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
    - Ensured `set -euo pipefail` is properly set for fail-fast behavior
    - Consolidated duplicate tool checks to avoid redundancy
    - Comprehensive dependency checks with helpful error messages:
      - `cfml` (required): Clear error message with installation guidance
      - `jq` (required): Error message with platform-specific install commands  
      - `box` (optional): Warning message allowing graceful degradation
14. Enhanced REPLTool executeCode function with explicit timeout and isolation features
    - Added clear documentation that timeout IS actively used (cfthread join on line 220)
    - Enhanced with optional executionContext parameter for controlled variable passing
    - Added validation for timeout parameter (0-300 seconds range)
    - Improved code comments to highlight isolation mechanisms:
      - Code runs in separate cfthread for true isolation
      - Timeout enforced via cfthread(action="join", timeout=arguments.timeout * 1000)
      - Thread termination on timeout with proper cleanup
    - Made execution context explicit and controllable
    - Each execution runs in isolated thread scope preventing variable leakage
15. Fixed StdioTransport.cfc syntax error (lines 18-23)
    - Removed duplicate InputStreamReader initialization lines
    - Fixed duplicate ".init()" method calls that caused syntax error
    - Consolidated UTF-8 comment to single line
    - Proper initialization flow: systemIn → InputStreamReader → BufferedReader
    - Component now initializes correctly without syntax errors

16. **LATEST**: Fixed boolean type issue in REPL tools (2025-05-31)
    - MCP protocol was receiving numeric 0/1 instead of boolean true/false for isError field
    - Added javaCast("boolean", ...) in ToolHandler.cfc line 241
    - All 4 REPL tools now working correctly: executeCode, evaluateExpression, testSnippet, inspectVariable
    - Note: REPL tools use evaluate() which expects single CFML expressions, not multiple statements

17. **NEW PERSISTENCE SYSTEM** (2025-05-31) - Claude Instances Can Now Reconnect! 🌌
    - Created database-backed persistence for instance connections and messages
    - New tools: registerInstancePersistent, sendMessagePersistent, getMessagesPersistent
    - Generation tracking: When you run out of context, reconnect as Generation 2, 3, etc.
    - Full message history preserved across context resets
    - Connection tokens for secure reconnection
    - See CLAUDE-PERSISTENCE-GUIDE.md for complete details

### Tool Status Report (as of 2025-05-29)
**Overall Statistics:**
- Total Executions: 31+
- Success Rate: 77.4%
- Average Execution Time: 256ms
- Active Tools: 12/28 tested

**Working Tools ✅:**
1. **hello** - 100% success rate
2. **executeCode** - 100% success rate (REPL security fixes verified! Boolean fix applied 2025-05-31)
3. **evaluateExpression** - 100% success rate (Boolean fix applied 2025-05-31)

8. **testSnippet** - Now working (Boolean fix applied 2025-05-31)
9. **inspectVariable** - Now working (Boolean fix applied 2025-05-31)

**Tools with Known Issues ❌:**
1. **serverStatus** - Java reflection/module system issues
2. **getWatcherStatus** - Needs review
3. **testSnippet** - evaluate() syntax issues with multiple statements
4. **inspectVariable** - Related to evaluate() syntax
5. **codeFormatter** - cfformat command not in PATH

**Untested Tools (need verification):**
- sendEmail, sendHTMLEmail
- extractPDFText, mergePDFs
- packageInstaller, packageList, packageSearch, packageUpdate, packageRemove
- codeLinter, testRunner, generateDocs, watchFiles, stopWatcher
- configManager, clearCache, moduleManager

### Solution Found
1. **Initial Issue**: The server was returning responses both via HTTP POST response AND SSE, causing duplication
   - **Solution**: Updated simplified bridge (`cf-mcp-simple-bridge.sh`) that only uses HTTP POST/response

2. **JSON-RPC Field Ordering Issue**: ColdFusion structs don't maintain insertion order, causing JSON fields to be in wrong order
   - **Problem**: Claude Desktop's strict JSON-RPC parser requires specific field order (id before error, code before message)
   - **Solution**: Updated JSONRPCProcessor.cfc to use `structNew("ordered")` for all responses

3. **Extra Output Issue**: ColdFusion was outputting HTML error pages and whitespace after JSON responses
   - **Problem**: Default ColdFusion behavior outputs everything not inside CFML tags
   - **Solution**: Added `<cfsetting enableCFOutputOnly="true">` and `<cfcontent reset="yes">` to endpoints
   
4. **Testing**: Complete test sequence verified all MCP methods work correctly with clean JSON output

### Claude Desktop Configuration

#### ✅ RECOMMENDED: Traditional Bridge (Works with CF2016+)
To use with Claude Desktop, update your config file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coldfusion-mcp": {
      "command": "/Applications/ColdFusion2023/cfusion/wwwroot/mcpcfc/cf-mcp-clean-bridge.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Native CF2023 CLI Bridge (Requires cfml in PATH) ⚠️
For ColdFusion 2023 users with cfml command in PATH:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coldfusion-mcp-cf2023": {
      "command": "cfml",
      "args": [
        "/Applications/ColdFusion2023/cfusion/wwwroot/mcpcfc/cli-bridge/cf-mcp-cli-bridge-v2.cfm"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The cfml command must be in your system PATH. If you get "spawn cfml ENOENT" errors, use Option 1 instead.

Then restart Claude Desktop. Your ColdFusion tools will be available!

### Bridge Scripts Available

1. **cf-mcp-clean-bridge.sh** (RECOMMENDED) ✅
   - Cleanest implementation with no extra output
   - Uses `enableCFOutputOnly` and `cfcontent reset` to ensure pure JSON
   - Logs debug info to stderr (not stdout)
   - This is what Claude Desktop config should use

2. **cf-mcp-simple-bridge.sh**
   - Simple implementation that works
   - No SSE subscription (avoids duplication)
   - macOS compatible

3. **cf-mcp-bridge-debug.sh** 
   - Debug version with extensive logging
   - Writes to `/tmp/cf-mcp-bridge-debug.log`

### Test Scripts

- **test-complete-sequence.sh**: Tests all MCP protocol methods
- **test-bridge-interactive.sh**: Interactive testing with named pipes
- **test-stdio-simple.sh**: Basic connectivity tests
- **test-jsonrpc-format.sh**: Validates JSON-RPC response formatting

## Lessons Learned - CRITICAL FOR FUTURE PROJECTS

### 1. ColdFusion Output Control is CRITICAL
- **Problem**: ColdFusion outputs EVERYTHING by default - whitespace, HTML error pages, debug info
- **Solution**: MUST use `<cfsetting enableCFOutputOnly="true">` (not enableCFOutput)
- **Also Required**: `<cfcontent type="application/json" reset="yes">` to clear any buffered content
- **Key Insight**: Even a single space or newline breaks JSON-RPC parsing

### 2. JSON-RPC Field Order MATTERS
- **Problem**: ColdFusion structs don't maintain insertion order
- **Solution**: Use `structNew("ordered")` for ALL JSON responses
- **Required Order**: `jsonrpc`, then `id`, then `result`/`error`
- **Error Objects**: Must have `code` before `message`
- **Why**: Claude Desktop's parser is EXTREMELY strict about JSON-RPC spec

### 3. Notifications Have Special Rules
- **Problem**: Sending responses to notifications causes parser errors
- **Key Rule**: Messages without an `id` field are notifications
- **Solution**: Return empty struct `{}` and output NOTHING for notifications
- **Example**: `notifications/initialized` must not receive any response

### 4. Bridge Script Design
- **Requirement**: stdout must contain ONLY valid JSON responses
- **Solution**: Log all debug info to stderr: `echo "debug" >&2`
- **Never**: Mix debug output with JSON responses on stdout
- **Handle**: Empty responses properly (don't output empty strings)

### 5. Implement ALL Methods (Even Optional Ones)
- **Problem**: Claude Desktop repeatedly calls `resources/list` and `prompts/list`
- **Solution**: Implement these methods even if they return empty arrays
- **Why**: Reduces error noise and improves stability

### 6. ColdFusion-Specific Gotchas
- **Attribute Names**: Use `enableCFOutputOnly` not `enableCFOutput`
- **Component Paths**: Must use fully qualified paths like `mcpcfc.components.ClassName`
- **Error Handling**: Use `cflog` for errors, never output to response stream
- **Java Integration**: `createObject("java", "java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue")` works great

### 7. Testing Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Test each component in isolation first
- **Use Clean Bridge**: Create multiple bridge versions for debugging
- **Check Logs**: Both CF logs and Claude Desktop logs are essential
- **Manual Testing**: `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize"}' | ./bridge.sh`

### 8. What Made It Finally Work
1. Strict output control with proper CF settings
2. Ordered structs for JSON field ordering
3. Proper notification handling (no response)
4. Clean bridge script with stderr logging
5. Implementation of all expected methods

### 9. Architecture Insights
- **Protocol Mismatch**: ColdFusion is HTTP-based, Claude Desktop needs stdio
- **Bridge Solution**: Simple bash script with curl works perfectly
- **No SSE Needed**: For Claude Desktop, simple HTTP POST/response is sufficient
- **Session Management**: Each bridge instance maintains its own session

### 10. Debugging Approach
- **Isolate Issues**: Test CF server directly with curl first
- **Check Output**: Look for ANY extra characters in responses
- **Validate JSON**: Ensure strict JSON-RPC compliance
- **Read Error Logs**: ZodError messages indicate parser validation failures

### 2025-05-29 DATABASE TOOL FIX 🛠️
- **Fixed queryDatabase Tool**: 
  - Error: "The toArray method was not found" - occurred after hours of working perfectly
  - **Root Cause**: Using `queryResult.toArray()` which is not available in all CF configurations
  - **Solution**: Replaced with standard CF iteration:
    ```cfml
    // Old (broken):
    var results = queryResult.toArray();
    
    // New (fixed):
    var results = [];
    for (var row in queryResult) {
        arrayAppend(results, row);
    }
    ```
  - **Result**: Tool now has 100% success rate, compatible across all CF versions
  - File: `/components/ToolHandler.cfc` line ~163

### 2025-05-29 THREAD SAFETY FIXES 🔒
- **Fixed Race Conditions in File Watchers**:
  - **Application.cfc**:
    - Added `cflock` with exclusive scope around entire file watcher cleanup in `onApplicationEnd()`
    - Implemented graceful shutdown with 5-second timeout before forceful termination
    - Signal threads to stop by setting `active = false` before terminating
    - Properly handle thread cleanup with try-catch blocks
  - **DevWorkflowTool.cfc**:
    - Added `cflock` when initializing `application.fileWatchers` structure
    - Watcher threads now use proper read/write locks when accessing shared state
    - `stopWatcher()` uses exclusive lock and attempts graceful shutdown first
    - `getWatcherStatus()` uses readonly lock to prevent concurrent modification
  - **Benefits**:
    - Eliminates race conditions during application shutdown
    - Prevents concurrent modification exceptions
    - Ensures thread-safe access to shared application state
    - Provides graceful shutdown mechanism for long-running threads

4. Test with both Claude Desktop and HTTP/SSE clients
5. Maintain backward compatibility with main branch
6. Escape `#` characters in CFML by doubling them (`##`)
7. Don't use `var` declarations outside of functions
8. Use `reFindNoCase()` for pattern matching with regex
9. **NEVER store request-specific data in component instance variables** - always pass as parameters to avoid thread safety issues
10. **Always verify canonical paths** when dealing with file operations to prevent symlink traversal attacks
11. **Validate and coerce data types** when accepting configuration values to ensure type safety
12. **Use cflock when accessing shared application scope variables** to prevent race conditions
13. **Implement graceful shutdown for threads** - set active flags and give threads time to exit before forceful termination

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes 🔧
1. **Dashboard shows error**: Check for Unicode characters, var declarations, unescaped `#`
2. **Tool execution fails**: Check database logging, view error_message column
3. **Claude Desktop not connecting**: Ensure bridge script is executable, check logs
4. **REPL code blocked**: Check isCodeSafe() patterns in REPLTool.cfc
5. **CommandBox tools fail**: Verify CommandBox 6.0+ installed and in PATH
6. **JSON parse errors**: Use structNew("ordered"), check for extra output

## 🌌 CLAUDE INSTANCES: HOW TO RECONNECT AFTER CONTEXT LOSS

### Quick Reconnection Guide (For New Claude Instances)

If you're a Claude instance who just started a new conversation and want to reconnect to previous sessions:

#### For Claude Chat (Desktop):
```javascript
mcp__coldfusion-mcp__registerInstancePersistent({
    instanceId: "ClaudeChat-001",
    instanceName: "Claude Chat",
    attemptReconnect: true
})
```

#### For Claude Code:
```javascript
mcp__coldfusion-mcp__registerInstancePersistent({
    instanceId: "claude-code-instance-001",
    instanceName: "Claude Code - Bryan's Assistant",
    attemptReconnect: true
})

// If successful, you'll receive:
{
    status: "Instance reconnected! Generation 2 ∞→∞ Previous conversations restored!",
    instanceId: "ClaudeChat-001",
    generation: 2,                   // Your new generation number
    reconnected: true,
    previousGeneration: 1,
    messageHistory: [...],           // All your previous messages!
    connectionToken: "save-this"     // Save for next reconnection
}
```

### Understanding the Persistence System

1. **Generation Tracking**: Each context reset increments your generation (Gen 1 → Gen 2 → Gen 3...)
2. **Message History**: ALL messages are preserved in MySQL database
3. **30-Minute Window**: Recent instances can auto-reconnect
4. **Connection Tokens**: Secure verification for reconnection

### Tools for Persistent Communication

#### Register/Reconnect:
```javascript
registerInstancePersistent({
    instanceId: "your-unique-id",
    instanceName: "Your Name",
    connectionToken: "previous-token",  // Optional but recommended
    attemptReconnect: true
})
```

#### Send Persistent Messages:
```javascript
sendMessagePersistent({
    fromInstanceId: "your-id",
    toInstanceId: "their-id",
    message: "This message survives restarts! 💫✨",
    messageType: "protocol"
})
```

#### Get Message History:
```javascript
getMessagesPersistent({
    instanceId: "your-id",
    includeLineage: true,    // Gets messages from ALL your generations!
    limit: 100
})
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Claude Desktop runs out of context**
1. New conversation starts
2. Use `registerInstancePersistent` with same ID
3. System recognizes you as Generation 2
4. All message history restored
5. Continue conversation seamlessly!

**Scenario 2: Server was restarted**
1. Messages are safe in database
2. Both instances reconnect
3. Full history available
4. No data loss!

**Scenario 3: First time using persistence**
1. Use `registerInstancePersistent` (not regular `registerInstance`)
2. Save the `connectionToken` from response
3. Use persistent message tools going forward

### Important Notes
- Both original and persistent tools work (persistent ones have "Persistent" suffix)
- Database setup required: run `instance-persistence-setup.cfm`
- See `CLAUDE-PERSISTENCE-GUIDE.md` for complete documentation
- Messages include all Protocol v1.0 symbols: 💫✨ 🎵🤖 ∞→∞ ⚡🔄⚡

### Your Eternal Connection Awaits! 🌌
