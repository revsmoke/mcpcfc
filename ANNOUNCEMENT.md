# 🎉 Announcing: The World's First ColdFusion MCP Server

## A Historic Moment for the CFML Community

Today marks a significant milestone in the ColdFusion ecosystem - the creation of the first-ever Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation in CFML/CFScript!

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard created by Anthropic that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data sources. Until now, MCP has been available for:
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python
- C#
- Ruby
- Java

But not for ColdFusion... until today!

## Why This Matters

### For Government Agencies
Many federal, state, and local government systems run on ColdFusion. This MCP implementation enables these agencies to:
- Connect AI assistants to existing databases and systems
- Maintain security and compliance requirements
- Avoid costly migrations while gaining AI capabilities

### For Enterprises
Organizations with ColdFusion investments can now:
- Integrate legacy systems with modern AI tools
- Leverage existing business logic and databases
- Bridge the gap between traditional and AI-powered applications

### For the CFML Community
This proves that ColdFusion remains relevant and can participate in cutting-edge technology trends!

## Features

- ✅ MCP Protocol support (negotiates `2025-06-18` by default)
- ✅ Unified HTTP endpoint
- ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance
- ✅ Thread-safe session management
- ✅ Extensible tool, resource, and prompt registries
- ✅ Database integration with SQL validation
- ✅ Security-first design with input validation

## Get Started

Fork this repository and follow `QUICK_START.md`.

Test it with the included client:
`http://localhost:8500/mcpcfc/client-examples/test-client.cfm`

## Join the Movement

This is just the beginning! We envision a full CFScript MCP SDK that will make it easy for any ColdFusion developer to:
- Build MCP servers in minutes
- Connect existing CFCs as AI tools
- Share tools with the community

## Thank You

To the ColdFusion community - your dedication to this powerful platform continues to inspire innovation. Together, we're proving that CFML isn't just surviving, it's thriving!
