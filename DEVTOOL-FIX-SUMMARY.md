# DevWorkflowTool Fix Summary

## Issue
The DevWorkflowTool.cfc had a syntax error on line 450 that prevented it from loading.

## Error Message
```
Invalid token \ found on line 450 at column 43.
```

## Root Cause
The regex pattern in the testRunner function was using Java-style `.matches()` method with improperly escaped backslashes:
```cfscript
arguments.directory.matches(".*[<>:\"|\\?\\*].*")
```

## Solution
Replaced with ColdFusion's native `reFindNoCase()` function:
```cfscript
reFindNoCase("[<>:\|\\?\\*]", arguments.directory)
```

## Result
- DevWorkflowTool now loads successfully
- All 7 tools are registered:
  - codeFormatter
  - codeLinter
  - testRunner
  - generateDocs
  - watchFiles
  - stopWatcher
  - getWatcherStatus
- MCPCFC project now has all 28+ tools working

## Lessons Learned
- Use ColdFusion native functions (reFindNoCase) instead of Java methods when possible
- Be careful with backslash escaping in CFML strings
- Always test tool registration after making changes
